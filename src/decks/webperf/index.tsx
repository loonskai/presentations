              These example is a sample of efforts that eventually end up to be
              positive for business. And in general I believe there a strong
              correlation between how our applications perform and how much
              revenue do they generate. But would be great for us in seeing the
              splendor of ... is to not fall victim to the survivirship bias
              because it's hard find stories where companies spent a huge effort
              trying to optimise for performance but ended up realising that it
              doesn't bring any value.
